## Welcommen to the Asphalt-inators house, entry pls!
The Asphalt-inator is a useful tool used to plan and build Streets on the map to get where you want, whenever you want, always on the road. The main aim of the robot is to trace some smart and pragmatic path to
connect the areas of its interest

## Usage
You start by deciding which type of street type are you going to build. Once your Asphaltinator
has designed ur desired Project you are ready to see some streets get built. To sum up and add
some information on this marvelous piece of engineering, here are the main functionality:

- Designing Projects: just designing projects... and recycle unfinished ones, but we will get on that later.

- Having FUN with your Asphalt-inator: with the function asphalt you can see your map starting to get more and more "concrete", the climate change will like this.

- Checks Design conditions: Verify if it is possible or not to ASPHALT the designed area, and require a minimum amount of resources from the robot.

The Asphalt-inator Struct is pretty simple, here's a breakdown:
- project_number: it stores the value of the number of projects designed
- unfinished_projects: it stores in a vector all the Unfinished Project, that for some reason happened to end, before they were completed, and that they still can be continued with the enough resources
